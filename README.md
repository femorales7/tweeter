# Tweeter Project
this repository contains the files for the operation of the tweet project, in this project we implemented different resources such as javascript, ajax, nodejs, html and css, we used asynchronous coding methods and you can see how the application reacts in real time to the different imputs that the user makes, it will also have a different design performance when changing the size of the image.
